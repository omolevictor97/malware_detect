Malware detection, the trained model generalizes signals and predicts whether or not
they are malicious signals <br>


Data is got from the link below:<br>
[data link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dscclass/malware/data) <br>

Three models were built, Adaboost, ExtratreesClassifier, RandomFroestClassifier were trained <br>

The deployment method used is streamlit, the best features were used in training, hence, prediction <br>

The best 10 features used for training and prediction are : <br>

'Machine', 'SizeOfOptionalHeader', 'MajorSubsystemVersion', 'Subsystem','DllCharacteristics', 'SizeOfStackReserve', 'SectionsMeanEntropy',
'SectionsMaxEntropy', 'ResourcesMaxEntropy', 'VersionInformationSize'
